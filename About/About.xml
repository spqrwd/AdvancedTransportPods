  <description>Adds a larger version of the transport pod to the game.

Maximum load capacity for these pods have been increased to 275kg. Due to the immense size of this monstrosity a small amount of plasteel is required for the construction. However, it still needs only one component, as the control circuitry has largely remained identical to its smaller predecessor.</description>
